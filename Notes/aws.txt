* AWS global infra

- Regions (22 as of Jan 2020) each with multiple availability zones.
- Availability zones (69) data centers isolated for HA and failure isolation.
- Edge Locations are where CloudFront, Amazon’s CDN (Content Delivery Network)
  caches content for geo-distribution. 
  216 Points of Presence : 205 Edge Locations and 11 Regional Edge Caches

* AWS Compute Services
- EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud)
EC2 is VMs in the cloud on which you have OS level control. 
Can also be bare metal.

- Elastic Beanstalk
 automated deployment and provisioning of resources like a highly scalable production website.

- EKS (Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes) 
The tool allows you to Kubernetes on Amazon cloud environment without installation.
ECS (Elastic Container Service)

- AWS Lambda 
FaaS This AWS service allows you to run functions in the cloud. The tool is a big
cost saver for you as you to pay only when your functions execute.

- Lightsail
Amazon’s Website Hosting Service (Virtual Private Service). Get ssh access and a DB access with a static (fixed) IP.

- Batch 
Used for Batch Computing where Batch Jobs are defined as docker containers

* Storage
- S3 (Simple Storage Service) - Object based storage service
- EFS (Elastic File System) - Network Attached Storage or NAS that can be mounted to multiple EC2s.
- Glacier - Data archival, cold storage. High cost (and time) to retrieve, low cost to store.
- Snowball - To import large amount (petabytes) of data into AWS. Looks like a suitcase.
- Storage Gateway - Virtual appliances that are hosted on-prem that transfer (replicate) data to AWS

* Networking and Content Delivery
- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) - A virtual datacenter
