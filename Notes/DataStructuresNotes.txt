Basically for algorithm related questions :
1. determine which data structures to use
2. running time/space complexity

Why big oh :
1. remove dependencies of languages or platforms.
2. Useful when the data set is very high, approaches infinity.
If it's very small then simpler data structs make sense.

* Arrays
+ fast, indexed
+ If you do not have insert and delete, choose array.
Can do search, min/max, pred/succ, rank, etc very fast.
+ Random access very fast
+ Space efficiency - contains purely data. No wastage of space.
+ Great locality ( Excellent cache hit rate)

- delete: hard to remove elements/recopy remaining elements.

* Dynamic arrays. 

Suppose we start with an array of size 1, and double its size
from m to 2m each time we run out of space. This doubling process involves
allocating a new contiguous array of size 2m, copying the contents of the old
array to the lower half of the new one, and returning the space used by the
old array.

The apparent waste in this procedure involves the recopying of the old contents
on each expansion. How many times might an element have to be recopied after a
total of n insertions? Well, the first inserted element will have been recopied
when the array expands after the first, second, fourth, eighth,
. . . insertions. It will take log2 n doublings until the array gets to have n
positions. However, most elements do not suffer much upheaval. Indeed, the (n/2
+ 1)st through nth elements will move at most once and might never have to move
at all.  If half the elements move once, a quarter of the elements twice, and
so on, the total number of movements M is given by 
M = (Sigma : for i=1 lg n)  i · n/2^i <= 2n 
=> amortization.

Thus, each of the n elements move only two times on average, and the total work
of managing the dynamic array is the same O(n) as it would have been if a
single array of sufficient size had been allocated in advance!

* Hash table
insert, delete, lookup based on a key
Can not find min/max/sort etc - use tree/list etc for those.
great for fast index/search.
also good to find duplicates.
+ Great cache hit since it's an array.

Dictionary

Application :
- De-duplication
(remove duplicates, find distinct visitors)
- 2-sum problem 
i/p unsorted array. o/p two numbers that add up to given sum.

1. Naive : O(n*n)
2. sort first nlog(n), then walk each one, 
look for sum-current num (search) nlog(n).
3. Insert all in H. then for each x in A, lookup sum-x in H
- Symbol tables in compiler : already defined or not.


* list
dynamic sizing easy 
(use for insert/delete, otherwise, you may want to use array)
sorted (ordered)
variation : stack/fifo

* Skip list
maintain a skip list of size square root of n
search through linked list much smaller now.
with O(√n) extra space, we are able to reduce the time complexity to O(√n).

* trees

- Binary trees : only 2 children (binary tree, BST, AVL, RB tree)

- B-tree (#children > 2)

- Min/Max Heap (highest (or lowest) is always stored at the root). not a sorted
 structure. (partially ordered). no particular relationship among nodes on any
 given level, even among the siblings.

- Trie

- Radix tree is a space optimized trie.
for eg roman and romantic share a node "roman"

- Patricia tree is a type of trie
issue with trie is for sparsely populated trie key, most internal nodes have only one child.
(consumes high space). 
Uses position in the node (say 5 or 2) to decide branching

Practical Algorithm to Retrieve Information Coded in Alphanumeric


* Binary tree 
Every node has upto 2 children : a left and right child (no
particular relationship among left and right)
e.g. of Binary tree
  1
 / \
2   3

- Binary tree versus BST :
BST : Binary search tree: Used for searching. Has strict ordering.
All left subtree must be < parent
All right subtree must be > parent
No duplicates
e.g. of BST 
  2
 / \
1   3

The binary tree can easily degenerate into its worst-case form, which is a
linked list, since simple binary trees are not balanced.

Applications of Binary tree : 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2130416/what-are-the-applications-of-binary-trees

- Huffman encoding (variable-length code table for encoding a source symbol
based on the estimated probability or frequency of occurrence (weight) for each
possible value of the source symbol.  more common symbols are generally
represented using fewer bits than less common symbols.

- Syntax tree (or Abstract syntax tree in Compilers)
or “parse tree” or “expression tree” for parsing a programming language

For example, the expression (1+3)*2 can be expressed as:

    *
   / \
  +   2
 / \
1   3

- The organization of Morse code is a binary tree.

This use of a binary tree is akin to reverse polish notation in a sense, in
that the order in which operations are performed is identical. Also one thing
to note is that it doesn't necessarily have to be a binary tree, it's just that
most commonly used operators are binary.

Traversals :

— depth-first traversal

There are 3 types of depth-first traversals, :

* PreOrder traversal - process current first and then left and then right;
Application (when to use): 
1. Duplicating a tree
2. polish notation (prefix) example + 3 4 

preorder(node)
  if node == null then return
  visit(node)
  preorder(node.left) 
  preorder(node.right)


iterativePreorder(node)
  parentStack = empty stack
  while (not parentStack.isEmpty() or node ? null)
    if (node ? null) 
      visit(node)
      if (node.right ? null) parentStack.push(node.right) 
      node = node.left   
    else     
      node = parentStack.pop()

* InOrder traversal - visit left child, then current and then right child;
Application : 
It gives the values in a sorted order.
1. Finding nth element in a given order. like, find 3rd smallest int in a BST.
2. Comparator for BST

inorder(node)
  if node == null then return
  inorder(node.left)
  visit(node)
  inorder(node.right)

iterativeInorder(node)
  parentStack = empty stack
  while (not parentStack.isEmpty() or node ? null)
    if (node ? null)
      parentStack.push(node)
      node = node.left
    else
      node = parentStack.pop()
      visit(node)
      node = node.right

* PostOrder traversal - visit left child, then right child and then current;
Application : 
1. freeing (or deleting) nodes or a tree
2. Reverse Polish notation (or postfix) 3 4 +

postorder(node)
  if node == null then return
  postorder(node.left)
  postorder(node.right)
  visit(node)

iterativePostorder(node)
  parentStack = empty stack  
  lastnodevisited = null 
  while (not parentStack.isEmpty() or node ? null)
    if (node ? null)
      parentStack.push(node)
      node = node.left
    else
      peeknode = parentStack.peek()
      if (peeknode.right ? null and lastnodevisited ? peeknode.right) 
        /* if right child exists AND traversing node from left child, 
        move right */
        node = peeknode.right
      else
        visit(peeknode)
        lastnodevisited = parentStack.pop() 

— breadth-first traversal

There is only one kind of breadth-first traversal : the level order traversal. 
BFS visits nodes by levels from top to bottom and from left to right.

levelorder(root)
  q = empty queue
  q.enqueue(root)
  while not q.empty do
    node := q.dequeue()
    visit(node)
    if node.left not null then
      q.enqueue(node.left)
    if node.right not null then
      q.enqueue(node.right)


BFS(G, start_v, end_v)     
    visited[v] = true
    Q.enqueue(start_v)
    while Q is not empty do
        v := Q.dequeue()
        if v == end_v then
            return true
        for all edges from v to w in G.adjacentEdges(v) :
            if visited[w] == false :
                 visited[w] = true
                 Q.enqueue(w)

* Binary search tree (it's NOT Balanced Search Tree)

BST is a binary tree with following properties :
- the keys in the left subtree are less then the key in its parent node P, 
in short L < P;
- the keys in the right subtree are greater the key in its parent node, 
in short P < R;
- duplicate keys are not allowed.

A "binary search tree" (BST) or "ordered binary tree" is a type of binary tree
where the nodes are arranged in order: for each node, all elements in its left
subtree are less-or-equal to the node (<=), and all the elements in its right
subtree are greater than the node (>).

Disadv of "binary tree" (and BST as well):
shape of a binary tree depends on order of insertions.
A BST although ordered, can also be unbalanced depending on what is the first
(root) node value and subsequent insertion values
=> They both can degenerate into O(n)!!! Height can go from log(n) to n.

This is exactly why some form of balanced trees are needed (for example AVL
trees/ RB tree etc).
NOTE : BST may NOT be a balanced tree.

Application of BST :
Search for free memory blocks in set of fixed memory ranges.

Summary :
Binary tree - no order, no balance
BST - ordered, no balance
AVL tree - ordered, balanced

InOrder traversal - 
	InOrder(left child)
	visit(node)
	InOrder(right child

The problem with this algorithm is that, because of its recursion, it uses
stack space proportional to the height of a tree. If the tree is fairly
balanced, this amounts to O(log n) space for a tree containing n elements. In
the worst case, when the tree takes the form of a chain, the height of the tree
is n so the algorithm takes O(n) space.

    Single Threaded: each node is threaded towards either the in-order
    predecessor or successor (left or right).

    Double threaded: each node is threaded towards both the in-order
    predecessor and successor (left and right).

* AVL tree:

In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at
most one; if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to
restore this property. Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take O(log n) time
in both the average and worst cases

* AVL tree versus RB tree

- AVL trees maintain a more rigid balance than red-black trees. The path from
  the root to the deepest leaf in an AVL tree is at most ~1.44 lg(n+2), while
  in red black trees it's at most ~2 lg (n+1).

As a result, lookup in an AVL tree is typically faster, but this comes at the
cost of slower insertion and deletion due to more rotation operations. So use
an AVL tree if you expect the number of lookups to dominate the number of
updates to the tree.

- RB tree constraint is that the path from the root to the furthest leaf is no
  more than twice as long as the path from the root to the nearest leaf. The
  result is that the tree is roughly height-balanced. Not rigidly balanced like
  AVL. So less number of rotations for insertion.

AVL tree : faster for lookups (since rigid)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16257761/difference-between-red-black-trees-and-avl-trees

Used when not much insert/delete

RB-tree : faster for insertions (less rigid, less rotations)

RB-Tree applications : for frequent insertions/deletion 
- Fax VoIP sessions
- http client sessions
- OSPF Ack cache
- H.323 call 

* B-tree versus B+ tree
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/870218/b-trees-b-trees-difference
In a b-tree you can store both keys and data in the internal and leaf nodes,
but in a b+ tree you have to store the data in the leaf nodes only.

Advantages of B+ trees:

Because B+ trees don't have data associated with interior nodes, more keys can
fit on a page of memory. Therefore, it will require fewer cache misses in order
to access data that is on a leaf node.

The leaf nodes of B+ trees are linked, so doing a full scan of all objects in a
tree requires just one linear pass through all the leaf nodes. A B tree, on the
other hand, would require a traversal of every level in the tree. This
full-tree traversal will likely involve more cache misses than the linear
traversal of B+ leaves.

Advantage of B trees:

Because B trees contain data with each key, frequently accessed nodes can lie
closer to the root, and therefore can be accessed more quickly.


* Binary heap, Min-heap/Max-heap
- Shape property, complete binary tree, except the last level.
- All nodes are either >= or <= than all of its children.

Heaps are commonly implemented with an array. Any binary tree can be stored in
an array, but because a binary heap is always a complete binary tree, it can be
stored compactly. No space is required for pointers; instead, the parent and
children of each node can be found by arithmetic on array indices.

Search O(n) // because there is no ordering of siblings.
Insert/delete O(log n)

Max heap : key(node) >= key(both children) at each level
Min heap : key(node) <= key(both children) at each level

insert in max heap (always inserts at the end or last leaf and then rebalance)
Step 1 − Create a new node at the end of heap.
Step 2 − Assign new value to the node.
Step 3 − Compare the value of this child node with its parent.
Step 4 − If value of parent is less than child, then swap them.
Step 5 − Repeat step 3 & 4 until Heap property holds.

delete in max heap (always deletes root and then rebalance)
Step 1 − Remove root node.
Step 2 − Move the last element of last level to root.
Step 3 − Compare the value of new root parent with both the children
Step 4 − If heap property of parent holds, we are done. 
Else If value of parent is less than child, then swap them.
Step 5 − Repeat step 3 & 4 until Heap property holds.

* hash tables
key-value pairs : no ordering
O(1) search
properties of a hash func: 
deterministic, uniform distribution,  variable range, crypto,
continuity (similar neighbors, hash almost same).
cuckoo hashing for collisions (two hash functions).
L2 mac tables use hash table.

* bloom filter : http://billmill.org/bloomfilter-tutorial/

new password check in dictionary - reject if edit distance of 1

graphs
can represent a network

2. determine the algorithm
- search

* sort
Divide and Conquer
- 1. divide in subproblem 
  2. solve subproblems recursively 
  3. merge
example Merge sort
why is merge sort nlog n ?
recursively sort left half (every time this becomes half-> log n)
recursively sort right half
merge two sorted arrays (4n+2)

merge :
C = o/p array length n
A= 1st sorted array n/2
B = 2nd sorted array n/2
i = j = 1					cost 2
for k = 1 to n					cost n
    if A[i] < B[j] : C[k] = A[i]; i++		cost 3n
    else C[k] = B[j]; j++

total cost 4n+2

at each level i=0,1,2,...,logn, there are 2^i subproblems. each size n/(2^i)
total cost at level i:  2^i * ( n/(2^i) ) = n
#levels : log n
total cost of sort : nlogn

total cost of merge sort : cost of merge(=n)  + cost of sort(= nlogn)

* Counting sort
The lower bound n log n does not apply to algorithms that do not compare array
elements but use some other information. 

Counting sort sorts an array in O(n) time assuming that every element in the
array is an integer between 0...c and c=O(n). The algorithm creates a
bookkeeping array, whose indices are elements of the original array. 
The algorithm iterates through the original array and calculates how many times
each element appears in the array.



* Topological sort
Maven build system specifies dependencies in a pom file.
Course work has pre-requisites.
Process Scheduling - A process can be scheduled only after dependent processes are done. 
Instruction scheduling
Packaging tools

dfs (u, visited[], stack) :
    visited[u] = true
    for all v = adj[u] :
        if (visited[v] == false) :
            dfs(v, visited, stack)
    // put in stack only when all edges are done
    // thus stack contains the topological sort
    stack.push(u)

topological_sort () :
    // set visited false for all vertices
    // start from any node
    for all vertices u = vertex
        if visited[u] == false :
            dfs(u, visited, stack)
    // Stack contains topological sort
    while (stack not empty) :
        print stack.pop()

* Counting inversion 
Input : array with numbers in arbitrary order
Output: #entries in out of order : = #pairs (i,j) i < j && A[i] > A[j]

Application : netflix movies. rank by person A and person B
how (dis)similar personA and person B ranking is.
depending on that we can sell the products (show relevant ad etc)
=> collaborative filtering

#inversions
sorted : 0
reverse order : n(n-1)/2
count_inversion (A, n) :
     if n=1 return 0
     x = count_inversion(left half of A, n/2)
     y = count_inversion(right half of A, n/2)
     z = count_SPLIT_inversion(A, n)

     return x+y+z

While merging two sorted subarrays, when an elem of 2nd right subarray
gets copied to o/p array, #split_inversions = #elems remaining in left array.
since all those elements in left array > this elem in right array.

* Randomized algorithms
Use randomness in the logic.
Two types :
1. Las Vegas Algorithms : random i/p random amt of time but correct o/p
2. Monte Carlo Algorithms : random i/p deterministic amt of time chance 
   of producing an incorrect o/p

example of randomization in algorithms :
quick sort, random pivot element
Also bloom filters.

Probabilistic data structures :

* Bloom filters
Similar to hash table : fast insert, fast lookup
+ Space efficient than hash table
+ If an object was not found, definitely not inserted.
- can not store the associated object
- no deletions
- small false positives possible.

Application :
spell checkers in dictionary.
forbidden passwords
routers (space constraint, speed) blocked IP addr
blacklisting URLs

Array of n bits
k hash functions

Greedy algorithms
- sequence of decisions myopic/shortsighted
example Dijkstra’s shortest path

easy to come up with one (heuristic)
hard to establish correctness - sometimes incorrect also (Dijkstra’s assumes no
negative edges, with -ve, it fails).


* Graphs :
G(V,E) n=|V| and m = |E|
adjacency matrix : space O(n*n)
adjacency list : space O(n+m)

* DFS and BFS

stack for DFS.
queue for BFS

BFS (used for shortest path)
- uses queue
- use when breadth is more and not much depth
- when you want to reach a node by traversing as few edges (or moves) as possible.
=> to find shortest path in unweighted graph.

BFS is better for problems related to finding the shortest paths or somewhat
related problems. Because here you go from one node to all node that are
adjacent to it and hence you effectively move from path length one to path
length two and so on.  

* When to use BFS ?
- shortest path, maximum flow
- linkedin kind of search, person A to  person G connected?
- for finding the neighbour nodes in peer to peer networks like BitTorrent, GPS systems to find nearby locations, 
- social networking sites to find people in the specified distance and things like that.

Time complexity O(|V|+|E|)

DFS - recursive - thus uses stack.

Connectivity
Detecting cycles
Topological Sorting
Maze solving

- DFS is more space-efficient than BFS, but may go to unnecessary depths.

If you had an infinite sized graph then DFS would never find an element if it
exists outside of the first path it chooses. It would essentially keep going
down the first path and would never find the element. The BFS would eventually
find the element

DFS (graph G, start vertex s)
	- mark S explored
	- for every edge (s, v)
		if (v not explored)
			DFS(G, v)

Running time linear because we do not do same work again (since we track “explored”).
O(m+n) m = |V|, n = |E|

When to use DFS?
- In games, like Chess, tic-tac-toe when you are deciding what move to make,
  you can mentally imagine a move, then your opponent’s possible responses,
then your responses, and so on. You can decide what to do by seeing which move
leads to the best outcome.
  Only some paths in a game tree lead to your win. Some lead to a win by your
opponent, when you reach such an ending, you must back up, or backtrack, to a
previous node and try a different path. 
  In this way you explore the tree until you find a path with a successful
conclusion. Then you make the first move along this path.


* Topological sort
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting
reverse post-order (not saame as pre-order)

Applications:
Scheduling a sequence of jobs or tasks based on their dependencies
Instruction scheduling
Determining the order of compilation tasks to perform in makefiles,
Resolving symbol dependencies in linkers

For every edge (u,v) f(u) < f(v)
As long as there is no cycle, we can compute topological order in O(m+n) using DFS.
Edges are one directional if u -> v, then no v -> u.

Draw edges left to right (forward) and connect all vertices.
No edge should go right to left (backwards) => topological order.
Every DAG has one sink vertex.

Example : pre-requisites of courses in university.

* Heap: 2 operations
Insert O(log n)
Extract-min (or extract-max) 
Heapify O(n)
Delete O(log n)


Selection Sort :
1 to n, pick the smallest,
2 to n, pick smallest 
…
quadratic

Heapsort :
insert in heap  - 
from last element of “full binary tree” to bubble-up with swap
extract-min pick smaller of child as root and bubble-down.

2nlog(n)

* Priority queue
Synonym for heap

Application :
Median maintenance : input - 1 million numbers. Find median.

Solution : Keep two heaps.

lowHeap smallest half -> maxHeap
highHeap biggest half -> minHeap
odd number can reside in any one.

example 
lowHeap holds small 10
highHeap holds big 10

21st element comes in, if smaller than rootlowHeap go to lowHeap, if bigger
than roothighHeap, then go to highHeap. if it’s between rootlowHeap and
roothighHeap, then choose anyone.  let’s say lowHeap now holds 11.  now 22nd
element comes in, let’s say it’s less than max in LowHeap.  so we insert in
lowHeap. 12 in lowHeap, 10 in highHeap.  extract from lowHeap and insert in
highHeap.


Quicksort
pivot element needs to be chosen
rearrange such that left of pivot : less than pivot.
right of pivot : > pivot
note that left or right partitions, not sorted yet.

Dynamic programming

- break down into overlapping subproblems. 
- solve each subproblem only once.
- compute once and store result (memoization)


Graphs
G(V,E) n=|V| and m = |E|
undirected : networks, phone network
directed : web (head points to a link), 
road (1-way, highway, with different #lanes each dir, uphill/downhill)

If we add distance X to all edges of the graph, will shortest path still be
same?  

- It may change (#edges times X,#edges can be different for diff paths).

If we multiple all edges of the graph by X, will shortest path be same?
- Yes.

* Edit distance : how dissimilar two strings are. 
Application : Spelling correction.

Levenshtein distance : 

The edit distance d(a, b) is the minimum-weight series of edit operations that
transforms a into b. Allowed operations : insertion, deletion, substitution.


Longest common subsequence (LCS) distance is edit distance with insertion and
deletion as the only two edit operations, both at unit cost.
