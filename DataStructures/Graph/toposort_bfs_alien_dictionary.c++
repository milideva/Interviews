269. Alien Dictionary

There is a new alien language that uses the English alphabet. However,
the order among the letters is unknown to you.

You are given a list of strings words from the alien language's
dictionary, where the strings in words are sorted lexicographically by
the rules of this new language.

Return a string of the unique letters in the new alien language sorted
in lexicographically increasing order by the new language's rules. If
there is no solution, return "". If there are multiple solutions,
return any of them.

A string s is lexicographically smaller than a string t if at the
first letter where they differ, the letter in s comes before the
letter in t in the alien language. If the first min(s.length,
t.length) letters are the same, then s is smaller if and only if
s.length < t.length.

Example 1:

Input: words = ["wrt","wrf","er","ett","rftt"]
Output: "wertf"
Example 2:

Input: words = ["z","x"]
Output: "zx"
Example 3:

Input: words = ["z","x","z"]
Output: ""
Explanation: The order is invalid, so return "".


Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 100
1 <= words[i].length <= 100
words[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.

  topo sort using BFS

  Kahn's algorithm:

  First, find a list of "start nodes" which have no incoming edges
  and insert them into a set S; at least one such node must exist in
  a non-empty acyclic graph. Then:


  L ← Empty list that will contain the sorted elements
  S ← Set of all nodes with no incoming edge

  while S is not empty do
    remove a node n from S
    add n to L
    for each node m with an edge e from n to m do
      remove edge e from the graph
      if m has no other incoming edges then
        insert m into S

  if graph has edges then
    return error   (graph has at least one cycle)
  else
    return L   (a topologically sorted order)


  An alternative algorithm for topological sorting is based on depth-first search.

  in-degree : number of Incoming edges. 
  indegree[a] = 0,  indegree[b] = 1,  indegree[c] = 1,  indegree[d] = 1,  indegree[e] = 2 ...

  A DAG (directed acyclic graph) must have at least one node with in-degree = 0. 
  If not, then it has a cycle and is not a DAG.
  (but having a node with in-degree 0, does not guarantee it's a DAG).

  We first build a graph. 
  for each edge u -> v
    record in-degree[v]++ ... as v has an incoming edge.
    graph[u].insert(v) ... insert v into the set of u which tracks all u's outgoing edges

  Now use classic BFS.
  We use a queue to start with the node with 0 incoming edges (in-degree is 0).
  Pop it off the queue, and add this to the result as we've no other dependency.
  then walk all its children/edges using the graph[u].set we built.
  decrement each child's incoming in-degree.
  if it's 0, then add it to the queue.
