An important property of a problem that is being solved through dynamic
programming is that it should have overlapping subproblems. This is what
distinguishes DP from divide and conquer in which storing the simpler values
isn't necessary.

The dynamic programming algorithm is based on a recursive function that goes
through all possibilities how to solve, like a brute force algorithm.
However, the dynamic programming algorithm is efficient because it uses
memoization and calculates the answer to each subproblem only once.
