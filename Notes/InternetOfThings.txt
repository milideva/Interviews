Internet of Things
==================
Cisco changed name to involve humans (Which are not things).
Internet of everything (Cisco), Smarter planet (IBM) Industrial Internet (GE)
New protocols
* IEEE 1901
* IEEE 1905
* MQTT (MQ telemetry transport), 
6LowPAN (ipv6 over low power wireless Personal area nw), 
RPL (routing protocol for low power and lossy network)
* Power line communication (PLC)
From 1990, X10, LonWorks, HomePlug
* Broadband over power line (BPL) like DSL.  IEEE1901 BPL standard.
Did not succeed in US (too many transformers, HF can not pass through transformers).
Not cost effective in US.
* HomePlug (1.0, AV, AV2, GP).
(distributing internet INSIDE house over electricity). Very cheap.
Does not work across certain circuits/transformer.
Everything is connected via electric wires anyway (fridge, tv, heater etc).
90% devices use HomePlug.

HomePLug V2 : 500Mhz! Multiple HD video streams possible.
Bigger spectrum.

HomePlug GP (GreenPHY): for HAN (home area network).
Monitoring and control of energy consuming/controlling EV charging.
Low Cost, low power, low data rate version of HomePlug.
HomePlug GP is a profile of IEEE 1901 (just like AV and AV2).
75% less power than AV.

Machine to machine (M2M), no human involved.
* smart phone, smart meters, tablets, medical devies, temp control etc
* Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)

Convergent Digital Home : IEEE 1905.1
* Abstraction layer between IP and L2 such as 802.3 or 802.11 or PLC 1901 or MoCA.

Outside home : Netricity.
Long range outside-the-home PLC for Smart Grid (low freq, narrowband).
IEEE 1901.2

Industrial ethernet:
Same as regular eth. Rugged connectors (Withstand rain/high low temp).
Full duplex (NO CSMA/CD).
Optical fiber (to avoid electrical interference with industrial).
Min frame size 64B too big. 64B for propagation delay.
Needs only 1B-4B to be sent from device, too much padding to 64B. 

Fieldbus : old way of industrial eth.

IEEE 1451
To query devices … set of smart transducer i/f for sensors/actuators.
XML based.

Smart Cards
* have a processor on it.
* May or may not have battery.
  Send wireless power, wakeup cpu. Does not really need battery. 
* RFID is a subset.
* Retail loss prevention, toll collection, bus/rail pass, passport.
* Active RFID : with battery: car key.
* Passive RFID : no battery. Tag on goods : shirts in Target.
* Semi-passive : cheap battery
* Get power from reader by inductive or capacitive coupling

Body Area Network
—————————————————
Smart card security issues.

IEEE 802.15.4
* WPAN (wireless personal area network).
* allows mesh (centralized) but is not ad-hoc.
Ad-hoc : peer-to-peer, computers talk to each other without access point.
