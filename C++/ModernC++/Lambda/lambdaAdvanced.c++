// Generalized capture (C++ 14)

// In C++14, you can introduce and initialize new variables in the capture
// clause, without the need to have those variables exist in the lambda
// functionâ€™s enclosing scope. The initialization can be expressed as any
// arbitrary expression; the type of the new variable is deduced from the type
// produced by the expression. One benefit of this feature is that in C++14 you
// can capture move-only variables (such as std::unique_ptr) from the
// surrounding scope and use them in a lambda.
