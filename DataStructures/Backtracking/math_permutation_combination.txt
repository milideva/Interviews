Permutation (AB != BA):
nPk = n!/(n − k)!
n Permute k ( AB != BA)
5P2 = 5!/3! = 5*4 = 20

In permutation, order matters, for example
A password.
Picking a President, VP and Waterboy from a group of 10.

Combination (AB = BA  hence must remove duplicates) :
Ordering does no matter.
Combination: Choosing 3 desserts from a menu of 10

n Choose k (no ordering AB = BA)
nCk = n! / (k! * (n − k)!) 
5C2 = 5!/(2! * 3!) = 10
