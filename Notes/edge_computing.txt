Why edge compute ?
* scale - data is massive from devices in some usecases
* low latency/real time - need ultra low latency processing for some usecases
* privacy, example, patient data in hospital should not go to cloud
  process that data at the hospital
* offload compute intense tasks to edge
* reduced transport cost


Broad category of edge computing applications
1. Third party
- Real time eg. AR/VR, connected car
- Immersive 4K video / 360 video
- self contained (stadium/concert)
- cost reduction (video surveillance)
- private/enterprise (RAN to enterprise breakout)

2. Operator Apps
- Analytics
- Compliance
- Security
- NFV


VR : VR encompasses all virtually immersive experiences. These could be created
using purely real-world content (360 Video), purely synthetic content (Computer
Generated), or a hybrid of both. This medium requires the use of a Head-Mounted
Device (HMD) like the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, or Google Cardboard.


AR : overlays computer genereated content on real world, can see physical objects
Google Translate’s AR feature “Word Lens” uses your camera to translate signs,
menus, and similar items in real-time from one language to another.

MR : Mixed Reality (MR) removes the boundaries between real and virtual
interaction via occlusion. Occlusion means the computer-generated objects can
be visibly obscured by objects in the physical environment—like a virtual robot
scurrying under your coffee table. 


XR : extended reality refers to all real-and-virtual environments generated by
computer technology and wearables. The 'X' in XR is a variable that can stand
for any letter.

* 5G Network slicing : 
- form of virtualization, multiple logical nw.s to run on top of shared phys nw
Grouping of traffic and isolation as well
- characteristic of applications very different
(e.g self driving car slice - ultra low latency
IOT slice - small data, huge number of IoT devices, battery sensitive
Video streaming - high throughput required, #devices small)

end to end config to meet requirements of application from radio access network + backhaul IP 
devices (phone) high speed bandwidth eMBB enhaanced massive BroadBand BW
IOT: low power, low packet size, 
connected car : ultra low latency uRLLC < 5mS, 

the slicing is done using segment routing (SR)

5G enabling technologies
- CUPS : Control & User Plane separation
- Network slicing using Segment Routing
- Mobile nw to scale video using MEC 
- Cloud scale with Cloud RAN/Core and SDWAN
