Depth First Traversals:
(a) Inorder (Left, Root, Right) 
    In-order traversal is used to retrive data of binary search tree in sorted order.

(b) Preorder (Root, Left, Right) 
    Preorder traversal is used to create a copy of the tree.
    Preorder traversal is also used to get prefix expression of an expression tree.

(c) Postorder (Left, Right, Root)
    Postorder traversal is used to delete the tree.
    Postorder traversal is also used to get the postfix expression of an expression tree.
